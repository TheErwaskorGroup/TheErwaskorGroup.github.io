# Welcome to the Erwaskor Group

This is the official account of the **Erwaskor Group**, where we share project updates, details, and more.  

## About Us

The Erwaskor Group was founded by **Nikolay** (aka ErwaskorElektr) and **Karsten** on **December 31, 2023**. The team currently includes one employee, **Cristiano**, who contributes to our growing projects and ideas.

### Our Origins  

Initially, the company was known as *Trev Enterprises*. During this time, we focused on developing our first project, **Mix OS** (formerly *Huber OS*). However, the name lacked identity and practicality.  

A breakthrough occurred when a unique term, "Erwaskor," was derived from a glitched AI voice output. The founders embraced the term and even coined the slogan:  
**"Du Erwaskor!"**  

In time, this playful concept evolved into a complete rebranding of the organization as the **Erwaskor Group**, giving the company a name and identity reflective of its creative and dynamic nature.
